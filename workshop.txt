description=reactivex - Reactive Extensions for Lua (Project Zomboid Build 42 library mod)

NOT TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER. DON'T USE THERE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. thx.

Reactive Extensions for Lua, packaged as a Build 42 library mod.
This is intended for mid-level Lua mod developers who want observable-style
event streams and composition operators in Project Zomboid.

This is a developer library, not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.
